# Facial and Emotional Recognition Model

This project aims to classify emotions from facial images using a machine learning model developed in Python and Jupyter Notebook. The model processes grayscale images, detects facial features, and predicts the corresponding emotions.

## Installation

To set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jzvikonyaukwa/facial_emotional_recognition.git
   cd facial-emotion-recognition
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Dataset

The dataset contains facial images and their corresponding emotion labels. Each image is grayscale, with a resolution of 48x48 pixels. The dataset is stored in `.csv` format, where each image is represented as a series of pixel values and an associated emotion label.

### Sample Data Processing Code:
```python
Pixel = []
emotion = []

getPixel = lambda x: Pixel.append([int(p) for p in x.split()])
getEmotion = lambda y: emotion.append(int(y))

df.pixels.apply(getPixel)
df.emotion.apply(getEmotion)
```

## Code Structure

- **`facial_emotion_recognition.ipynb`**: Contains all the steps from loading the dataset, preprocessing, training, and evaluating the model.
- **`data.csv`**: The dataset with pixel data and corresponding emotion labels.
- **`models/`**: Directory where trained models are saved.

## Usage

1. Load the dataset:
   ```python
   fer2013_path = "/content/drive/My Drive/Colab Notebooks/Advanced_AI/project/facial_emotion_detection/fer2013.csv"
   df=pd.read_csv(fer2013_path, na_filter=False)
   ```

2. Preprocess the data, build the model, and train it. After training, visualize the results and predictions using Matplotlib.

## Results

Once the model is trained, you will get results indicating the accuracy of emotion prediction on test data. The predicted emotions will be visualized along with the facial images.

## Dependencies

The following libraries are required:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- TensorFlow (or PyTorch)

To install them:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
